# Applied Quantitative Finance Models

This repository contains models developed as part of my Applied Quantitative Finance course. These models were created specifically for the final exam, where students were allowed to bring their own code to apply and analyze financial data.

## Overview
This project contains a suite of quantitative finance models focusing on portfolio optimization, risk assessment, and pricing simulations. Each model is designed to provide insights into complex financial decisions and to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.

1. **Optimization of Portfolios with Sharpe Ratio and Volatility Optimization**: This model targets achieving the highest risk-adjusted return and/or minimum volatility through efficient portfolio allocation. It balances the trade-off between return and risk to deliver an optimal portfolio configuration.

2. **Generalized Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) Analysis**: This analysis minimizes the overall risk by focusing on portfolios with the lowest possible volatility for a given set of assets. It’s particularly valuable for risk-averse investors or as a foundational portfolio within multi-strategy investments.

3. **Monte Carlo Portfolio Optimization**: By simulating thousands of potential portfolio paths, this model uses probabilistic outcomes to identify optimal asset allocations, accounting for various market conditions and volatility structures. This approach provides a robust view of potential returns, even under uncertain market dynamics.

4. **Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model**: Implementing the classic Black-Scholes formula, this model estimates the theoretical price of European-style options, taking into account market variables like volatility and time decay. It’s essential for options traders and risk managers to evaluate fair value and market discrepancies.

5. **Brownian Motion Option Pricing Model**: Using a stochastic process, this model extends pricing beyond standard assumptions, simulating random asset paths to forecast potential price outcomes. It offers a more flexible approach to understanding price distributions and is helpful for modeling complex derivative structures.

## Educational Objectives
These models aim to bridge the gap between academic finance concepts and real-world applications. Each exercise builds upon foundational principles in finance, encouraging students to:
- Experiment with optimization techniques and understand risk-return trade-offs
- Gain proficiency in statistical simulations and probability-based modeling
- Analyze pricing dynamics and apply theoretical pricing models to various assets.
